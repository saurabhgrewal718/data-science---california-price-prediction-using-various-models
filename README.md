# data-science---california-price-prediction-using-various-models
here i have implemented the problem of california price predication probelm...preprocessed the data....and after that made the data pipelines...to process the data..and at last used varioius models to make the predicatons...including linear regression,RandomForestRegressor and tree regressor

this notebook contains the technieques on how i did the exploratory anlysis on the data which was given

Playing with the data by making the initial grpahs which shows which features are realted loosely and which features are related closely

after this we made the futhur scatter plots of the data and used got the following map

finally we choose to plot all those data point on the real image of california to see how exactly it looks on screen

## after doing all that preprocessing of the data...we made data pipelines and choose 3 models to check the best accuracy...and finally out of LinearRegression,TreeRegressor and random forest regressor we find out the modle whoch works best woth our data...and finally that will be the winner !
